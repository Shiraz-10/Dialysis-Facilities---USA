This project was done to visualize the total number of Dialysis facilities registered with Medicare and Medicaid, so that Safr Care (A platform that facilitates Non-Emergency Medical Transportation) can assess which states require the most NEMTs.  
The amount of NEMT providers required is a direct relation to the readmission rates of these dialysis facilities, as each patient will require NEMT to get to their appointments.  
The data was collected from the official Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services website, available at:  https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/topics/dialysis-facilities/data-sources
